Each problem is stored in its own folder within the appropriate category. The folder name follows the LeetCode convention: `{problem-number}-{problem-name}`.

Each problem folder contains:
- `README.md` - Problem description from LeetCode
- Solution files (e.g., `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`, etc.)
- `Notes.md` - (Optional) Additional notes and explanations

## Contributing

When adding a new problem:
1. Create a new folder in the appropriate category
2. Name it following the convention: `{number}-{problem-name}`
3. Add the problem description and solution files

Happy coding! 🚀
